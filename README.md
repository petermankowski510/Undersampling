# Undersampling
Undersampling option: 1, 2 and 3
Near Miss refers to a collection of undersampling methods that select examples based on the distance of majority class examples to minority class examples.
The approaches were proposed by Jianping Zhang and Inderjeet Mani in their 2003 paper titled “KNN Approach to Unbalanced Data Distributions: 
A Case Study Involving Information Extraction.”
There are three versions of the technique, named NearMiss-1, NearMiss-2, and NearMiss-3.
